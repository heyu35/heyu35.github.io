excerpt: 'Physical activity (PA) is considered beneficial for lowering cardiovascular risks following type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetes, but existing evidence relies mainly on self-reported measurements. We aimed to describe the intensity-specific dose-response associations of PA and sedentary behavior (SB) with macrovascular and microvascular events among individuals with T2DM and prediabetes.'
