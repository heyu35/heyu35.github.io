### Million
![小狗](/images/million.png)
Million, a female Maltipoo (spayed), born in December 2023 🎂. She’s a total ray of sunshine— the second-born princess at home. Her whole vibe? Eating! She loves munching on everything, and her favorite snack low-key? Cat food. Pro tip: If something goes missing in the house, check her dog bed— it’s probably there!
